<p>Dave Clark and Rebekka Anderson’s article Renegotiating with Technology: Training towards More Sustainable Technical Communication has many similar thoughts of what the technical communicators can do to make their profession Technical Communication more valuable to the companies they work for as the other readings we have read in class. The authors, Clark and Anderson believe that technical communicators are focusing too much on the technology applications of the tools like XML, HTML, content management, and other types of single sourcing instead of focusing on knowledge management. If the technical communicators focused more on knowledge management they would learn more about more important organizational factors and use them in their profession like collaborating with other fields, gaining business skills, and management skills. However, technical communicators focused more on tools like XML because during the 1980s computer technologies began to innovate and they had to change the way they produced their work because people wanted to get information documents electronically. Moreover, technical communicators had to learn how to use and create better tools so they could keep working at their companies and the new computer software companies, since they know how to communicate new information more clearly and precisely to their consumers. Also, technical communicators focused more on technology applications is because they believed that their use of tools like XML would expand their knowledge and status in useful ways when they produce the XML code since it helps them provide data with context. The authors also believe that if technical communicators keep categorizing different technology applications as just “tools” their profession will become less valuable to other fields like business, engineering, etc because they are always innovating their profession. Finally, the authors believe that if technical communicators want to progress their profession and be taken more seriously at their workplace, then they should start to promote and develop their own technology applications by publishing their thoughts and research outside their own journals and share their knowledge and skills with other organizations.</p>
